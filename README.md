# Cataloger
small utility, created using twinBASIC (https://twinbasic.com/preview.html) to catalog general items, this uses 75 x 100 images. They need to be pre sized before adding them.
it creates a data folder where it places text files which are the name of the items, in that is the associated image. images are stored in the data\image folder and are copied there when selected in the app.
